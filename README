(1) The rubyzip gem does not support creating a zip file exceeding 4 GB size.
It throws some weird errors - refer below

There is an option in rubyzip library to enable ZIP64 support - 
Zip.write_zip64_support = true, by default this is disabled.

(2) Also, the unix zip utility has some size constraints - refer below -
http://superuser.com/questions/319562/linux-zip-greater-than-4gb
The zip tool needs to be upgraded to one that supports Zip64, i.e. Zip 3.0
Basically, ZIP64_SUPPORT needs to be enabled in zip compilation options to store large files in archives.

(3) The better option is java.util.zip which does not have size limitation and is pretty fast as well.

With JRuby, you can make use of Java libraries in Ruby effectively.
The JavaZipUtil class offers some useful methods like zip file with specific extensions, extraction of all files and extraction of selective files.
